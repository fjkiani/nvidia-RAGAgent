    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, we learned about embedding models and exercised some of their capabilities. We discussed their intended use cases of longer-form document comparison and found ways to use it as a backbone for more custom semantic comparisons. This notebook will progress these ideas toward the retrieval model's intended use case and explore how to build chatbot systems that rely on *vector stores* to automatically save and retrieve information.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how semantic-similarity-backed systems can facilitate easy-to-use retrieval formulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn how to incorporate retrieval modules into your chat model systems for a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, which can be applied to tasks like document retrieval and conversation memory buffers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Questions To Think About:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This notebook does not attempt to incorporate hierarchical reasoning or non-naive RAG (such as planning agents). Consider what modifications would be necessary to make these components work in an LCEL chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider when it would be best to move your vector store solution into a scalable service and when a GPU will become necessary for optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Notebook Source:**\n",

The best\\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based\\nsolely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be\\nsuperior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results,\\nincluding ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French\\ntranslation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art\\nBLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction\\nof the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the\\nTransformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to\\nEnglish constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.'}\n",

Unlike recent\\nlanguage representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep\\nbidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on\\nboth left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT\\nmodel can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create\\nstate-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering\\nand language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture\\nmodifications.\\n  BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new\\nstate-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including\\npushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI\\naccuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering\\nTest F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).'}\n",
